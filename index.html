        <h3>biography</h3>
        <p>
          Born in Louisville, Kentucky, in 1942, Muhammad Ali began boxing at
          the age of 12 and quickly became a successful amateur boxer.
          <br /><br />
          In 1964, he defeated Sonny Liston to win the world heavyweight
          championship and become the youngest heavyweight champion in
          history.<br /><br />
          Throughout his career, Ali was involved in several high-profile
          fights, including the "Fight of the Century" against Joe Frazier and
          the "Rumble in the Jungle" against George Foreman.<br /><br />
          Ali was also a political activist and refused to be drafted into the
          army during the Vietnam War, for which he was stripped of his boxing
          title.<br /><br />
          After retiring from boxing, Ali continued to be an ambassador for
          peace and humanitarian causes and remains an inspiration to millions
          around the world as one of the greatest boxers of all time.
